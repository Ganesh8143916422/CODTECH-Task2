# Student Grade Management System

## Overview

This Python program is designed to manage and track student grades. It allows the user to input grades for various subjects, calculates the average grade, and provides the corresponding letter grade and GPA. The program is suitable for managing grades in educational systems or personal tracking of academic performance.

## Features

- Allows input of grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
- Calculates the average grade across all subjects.
- Displays the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average grade.
- Calculates and displays the GPA on a 4.0 scale.
- Prints a detailed report of grades for each subject, the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects they wish to input grades for.
2. For each subject, the user is asked to enter the subject name and the grade received in that subject.
3. The program then calculates the average grade.
4. Based on the average grade, the program determines the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and GPA (on a scale of 4.0).
5. Finally, the program outputs a report with the subject-wise grades, the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher.
- No additional libraries or external dependencies are required.
